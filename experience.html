                <h4><strong>Introduction/Problem Statement</strong></h4>
                    <p class="text-dark lead text-justify d-flex align-self-center"> Over the years, Wisconsin Information Technology (IT) students find it difficult to excel in their exams unlike in other departments. With the fast-paced advancements made within the technology sector, they struggle to meet the skill set requirements.  Learning courses such as C++, Java, Probability, etc., can be very tedious at times, because they require more coding practice and more related learning materials. As a consequence, students often resort to relying on lengthy internet searches for similar learning resources.  The availability of learning materials can have salient effects on students’ performance.  This is where WizzyGeeks comes in handy. WizzyGeeks is more than just another technology learning website because it is customized just for Wisconsin International University College (WIUC) Students.  The basis of this site is for students to hone Computer Science and Information Technology computing skills.  The Website will keep track of the School’s curriculum in this related field; this means it will have solutions to exercises and past questions on related courses. In addition, WizzyGeeks aims at training students to meet current industrial needs with sufficient content on programming with Java and C++.

                    <p class="text-dark lead text-justify d-flex align-self-center"> User interfaces for software applications can come in a variety of formats, ranging from command-line, graphical, web application, and even voice. While the most popular user interfaces include graphical and web-based applications, occasionally the need arises for an alternative interface. Whether due to multi-threaded complexity, concurrent connectivity, or details surrounding execution of the service, a chat bot based interface may suit the need.
                            Chat bots typically provide a text-based user interface, allowing the user to type commands and receive text as well as text to speech response. Chat bots are usually a stateful services, remembering previous commands (and perhaps even conversation) in order to provide functionality. When chat bot technology is integrated with popular web services it can be utilized securely by an even larger audience.
